How the translation was done:
-----------------------------

All translations of Czech comments in the code were inserted
either on the same line marked with "(tr.: ...)" or on the next line
beginning with "// tr.: ". Only in a few cases I changed very simple
comments that where some kind of a mixture of Czech and English
into pure English. 

I left almost all Czech comments in their place, as in some cases
I was not sure about terminology (eg.: souhrnn  paleta = composite
palette?), and in other cases I was not able to decide whether a word
was meant as grammatical subject or object. Semantical and grammatical
alternatives in the translation are indicated by "/" (eg. "through/on").
"???" indicates that I had no idea how to translate a (presumedly)
Czech expression. 

I preferred  to leave deleting of the original Czech comments
to those, who understand the code.
