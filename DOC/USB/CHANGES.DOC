==========

  USBUHCI & USBUHCIL
  ------------------
    * Changed Version Number to 0.14.
    * Removed new memory allocation strategy for TSR.  It was still having
        problems with multiple host controllers and certain combinations
        of DOS versions and memory managers that could not be resolved.
    * Fixed bug in original memory allocation strategy for TSR that did
        not close file handles on program termination.
    * Various minor code adjustments.

  USBUHCI & USBUHCIL
  ------------------
    * Changed Version Number to 0.13.

==========

  USBUHCI & USBUHCIL
  ------------------
    * Changed Version Number to 0.12.
    * Fixed FindRegIntf & FindUnRegIntf requests to work properly across
        multiple hosts.  Unfortunately, fixing it to work across multiple
        hosts has broken it for a single host (when issuing for a single host,
        the original I14RSearchIndex value is changed when it should not be).
        A future version of the API will fix this problem by adding
        InterHostFindRegIntf and InterHostFindUnRegIntf requests.
    * Adjusted error codes for FindReg/UnRegIntf API Requests to match
        documentation.
    * Adjusted code to allow devices which have a configuration value of
        zero to not be rejected.  Such devices are patently illegal according
        to the USB specifications, but some of them are known to exist.
        A future version of the API will include a special flag indicating
        the existence of such a Device.
    * Fixed the return value in CX (number of bytes sent during the data
        stage) at the end of a Control Request.  It would previously return
        an incorrect value if the last packet was short.
    * Switched from using the standard DOS TSR multiplex interrupt (INT 2Fh)
        to AMIS (Alternative Multiplex Interrupt Specification), which uses
        INT 2Dh.
    * Switched to a new method of installing automatically into Upper Memory,
        which in certain cases reduces the number of unusable "memory holes"
        left after a TSR is installed.  The technique and sample code were
        provided courtesy of Christian Masloch.
    * Created a special signature to allow call-back writing from future
        versions of the support programs (USBSUPT1, HIDSUPT1, etc.) to work
        properly.
    * Added the dollar sign ("$") as an allowable prefix to indicate a
        hexidecimal number for command-line input options.  Previously,
        only the "0x" prefix (C syntax) and/or the "h" suffix (ASM syntax)
        were allowed.
    * Various minor code optimizations and adjustments.
